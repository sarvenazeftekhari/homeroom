## What is HomeRoom?

HomeRoom is a gamified assignment tracker that makes getting school work done fun and competitive. Students can create an account, join or create classes, track their assignments, and earn XP points based on how well and how quickly they complete their work.

The better your grade and the earlier you submit, the more XP you earn. Each class has its own leaderboard so you can see how you rank against your classmates. You can also spend your XP in the Point Shop on boosters and power-ups to gain an edge — or sabotage your rivals 😈

### Setting up the project (do this once)

**1. Clone the repo:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/sarvenazeftekhari/homeroom.git
cd homeroom
```

**2. Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

**3. Set up your Firebase environment variables:**

Create a file called `.env` in the root of the project and ask a teammate for the values. It should look like this:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_value
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_value
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_value
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_value
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_value
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_value
```

> ⚠️ Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.

### Running the app locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:5173**

The site will automatically update every time you save a file.

To stop the server: press `Control + C` in the terminal.

## How XP is Calculated

XP is awarded when you enter your grade for a submitted assignment. The formula takes into account:

- **Grade** — higher grade = more base XP
- **Difficulty** — Easy (1x), Medium (1.5x), Hard (2x) multiplier
- **Timeliness** — submitting early earns bonus XP (up to +100 XP)
